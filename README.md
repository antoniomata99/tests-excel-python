# I'm just doing some tests with Python

# What does this project contain?

As you can see, it only contains an xlsx file called "ARCHIVO_EJEMPLO" in the "data" folder and the code is in the "src" folder.

# How to make this code work?
1. Install numpy `pip install numpy`
2. Install pandas `pip install pandas`
3. Install openpyxl `pip install openpyxl`
4. Enjoy!
